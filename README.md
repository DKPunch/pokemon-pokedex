# pokemon-pokedex

This was an assignment given about half way through my second term of
Computer Science. The program opens a text file full of Pokemon data 
that is input by the user and stores the data into memory dynamically. 
This was our first time being required to write a program that used 
dynamic memory and our first oppurtunity to test what we had learned 
about pointers. I have included a text file (pokemon.txt) to use with 
the program for optimal use.
