# Pokemon Pokedex

This was an assignment given about half way through my second term of
Computer Science. The program opens a text file full of Pokemon data 
and stores the data into memory dynamically. This was our first time 
being required to write a program that used dynamic memory and our first 
opportunity to test what we had learned about pointers.

# How to use

Upon execution the program will ask the user for the name of a text file 
to open for data manipulation. I have provided an ideal text file (pokemon.txt) 
for optimal use. After loading the file, an option menu will appear.
